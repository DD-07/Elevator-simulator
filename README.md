# Elevator-simulator

---

This is meant to be a project for me to create an... elevator simulator! You guessed it!

So basically, I wanted to add 'levels' to this elevator, and using a very simple python program, I'll allow the user to go to any floor they like, and they'll receive a random fun fact about that number.

So for example for 1, it's the number of public telephones in Kabul

This project was created for hacktoberfest, and I'm happy that it gives me the rare opportunity to continue to work on my programming... even though it sucks a lot.

Good luck Dylan!
